# TESS_LC_Quickstart_Tutorial
NOTE: many new changes to Lightkurve mean that some/much of this may be out of date.

This is a quick and easy guide to using the Python module Lightkurve to download and create light curves from TESS data.  This tutorial only uses the functions of Lightkurve that operate when an object has a known TIC (TESS Input Catalog) ID number.

Documentation for Lightkurve functions can be found at https://docs.lightkurve.org/api/.
